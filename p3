<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Club provides beach patrols by rostering Active mebers aged 13 - 30 years and above to patrol squads. These squads are then placed on a roaster invloving attendance at the beach for a day or weekend at varying frequency depending on the Clubs active membership strength.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Members aged over 30 with current bronze Medalion are welcome to turn up and join any roster patrol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A members function within a patrol can varry depending on their qualifications and can include first aid, rescue boat crewing, radio room operations, foot and four wheel drive patrols.

<p>Calendar/Roster have been emailed to patrolling members in early November. There will be an update in January incorparating new SRCs/Bronzeys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All patrolling members are obliged to attend their rostered patrols or arrange for a substitute patroller if they cannot attend. The roster has been arranged so that both Aussie titles and State titles are patrolled by members who usually dont compete, but it is nearly immposible to arrange the roster to not clash with some carnivals or other events. If your work or study commitments make it impossible to be on the roster for the whole season, please contact the Club captain at clubcapt@oceangroveslsc.asn.au to explain your circumstance so that appropriate arangements can be made so that you can fulfil you patrol comitments and remain an active member of the club. Penalties can apply for no shows which usually involve make up patrols but can in some cases involve refusing you entry into a carnival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are simple ways to find a sub:<br><strong>Act early and give plenty of notice</strong> - Check the roster and if you know you have clash start finding a substitute as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Check the roster and see what awards and duties you have</strong> - Substitues need to have simmilar awards to you but may not necessarily have to have exactly the same ones; for example , if you are rostered as an IRB driver for a patrol and hold your ART and First Aid your sub will need to hold an IRB drivers award but may not have to have an ART or First Aid Award in order to substitute you as a truck driver.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Get in touch with substitutes directly</strong> - Contact numbers are on the patrol groups document ( Members - Dont be shy , you will find that members are quite accomodating if they are asked directly to substitute. (A good trick is to look at the anual report and see who does lots of patrol hours; they maybe happy to do a sub for you as they will be patrolling anyway!) Remember tough you still have to complete 16 hours per season . There is an active reserve list at the bottom of the Patrol Roster and many of the active reserves will be willing to help out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When you find a sub</strong> - Please contact your Patrol Captain to let them know the name of the sub.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If after trying all the above you still cant find a substitute</strong> - Contact your Patrol Captain and explain the situation OR Contact the Club captain and explain your situatuion outling the steps you have taken to find a sub.</p>
