<h1>Requalification</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To remain eligible to patrol and compete, members must re qualify their awards yearly, at the start of the season. All expire on 31 December, e g. requals done in late 2019 for 2019/20 season will expire end December 2020. SLSA gives a grace period of four years in which a lapsed award can be re-qualified. After this period, the award must be completed from scratch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Online theory completion is required for SRC, Bronze Medallion, ARTC, IRBC and IRBD candidates. Please make sure that you complete your online theory component and BOOK IN ONLINE for the practical componenet.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go to Life Saving Victoria Skills Maintenance from Anywhere to do your theory online and book in to do your requal. The good news is that once you've set up a Skills Maintainance from Anywhere account, you can now access it via your Members Area account: eLearning &gt; Login to eLearning. For family groups, only the Primary member can access theirs through the Member Area. Once other family members start gaining awards they should set up their own Members Area account, which will allow them to keep track of their own awards and patrol hours. They can still remain in their family group on the database.</p>
